# Interacting with Multimodal models in GitHub Models and Microsoft Copilot

**Innovate with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o multimodal model in this hands-on experience in GitHub Models and Microsoft Copilot. Learn the core concepts and best practices to effectively generate with text, sound, and images using GPT-4o-mini and Copilot.**


This workshop is for the [Global AI Bootcamp 2025](https://globalai.community/bootcamp)

## Description
This workshop is designed to give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models in GitHub Models portal. We will be running the workshop using [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) and [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

### Duration
45 - 60 minutes

## Learning Outcomes
* Understand how Large Language Models work, including what tokens are​.
* Explore Prompt Engineering techniques and best practices​
* Understand how models apply existing knowledge​

## Technology Used
* GitHub Models
* Microsoft Copilot


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe GitHub Models capabilities and implementation in the fields of text generation, image generation and multimodal conversation.
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices.
 - Leverage generative AI capabilities and apply prompt engineering techniques to your own solutions.

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into 3 sections, taking you through generating text content, image assets, and code snippets through a multimodal conversational interface on GitHub models. The goal of the lab is to leverage generative AI capabilities over a wide range of scenarios.

1. **Part 1 - Text Generation** Generate text content and descriptions with GPT4o
2. **Part 2 - Image Generation** Generate image assets with DALLE-3
3. **Part 3 - Multimodality** Leverage multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o to interact with images and text.
